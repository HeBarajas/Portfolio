                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <Strong><small>I currently live in the Houston area. I was attending school at Lone Star College to study computer science but then I heard about coding bootcamps.
                    So, I decide to take a break from school to take a coding bootcamp session. I worked in restaurants, sales consulting, construction, customer service, and now I work as a delivery driver
                for Dominos Pizza. Through all the fields I work in the past I found that none of those were a fit for me so that made me want to pursue what I orginally wanted to do, which was Software Engineering.</Strong>

                    I started consistently working out December of last year and its been quite a journey my main reason I started working out was to gain weight since I quite underweight but its became
                one of my main hobbies after a few months since I fell in love with it. </h1></li>
